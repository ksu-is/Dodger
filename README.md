# INTRODUCTION
OfflineTV Remix of the game Dodger.
This game uses Python 3.xx and pygame in order to run. Make sure you have both before trying to run.

# GAME RULES 
You are Fedmyster (red box that says fed), a popular streamer from the OfflineTV house. Unfortunately, you seem to keep getting hit by Twitch bans. Your goal is dodge the Twitch bans as much as possible. 

Luckily, as you keep succeeding, your best friend and fellow streamer Pokimane will come by to help you out. Go meet her and see what happens!

# GAME MECHANICS
Use WASD, arrow keys, or your mouse to move around. Your score increases as enemies reach the bottom of the screen (you have succesfully dodged them). You start with a maximum of 3 enemies at one time and a relatively slow max enemy speed. As your score increases, so does the number of enemies and the maximum speed they can reach.

# SONGS USED
Background song is Boombox Cartel X QUIX Supernatural Moshroom Remosh. This is more well known as the Fedmyster intro song.
Game over song is the game over song bit from Mario.
